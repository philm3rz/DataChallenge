Unless you were on the flight deck you don’t know.  I still personally don’t think any of the flight deck would do this during Take off.  If they did I would suspect they have some explaining to do   \n",

As that price isn't available, it's not possible to make a booking using that price, as it's an error online. However, the actual price is available when the flight options are on the screen.

As long as the ticket is for travel between 3 and 30 March, no matter when bought, you should be able to change/get a voucher.  At least, I did (bought my ticket in January). Hope this helps   \n",

But I am paying the same price on silk air as air Asia for this trip and just looknat the difference! Airlines can do it. Some just choose not to. Maybe I'm from another age where hospitality had value. Easyjet ok, but Ryan? I'd rather walk.\n",

We don't operate flights to Vietnam ourselves so you'll have a connection with one of our partners. I'm afraid we're unable to provide assistance with visas here and would recommend speaking with the embassy directly for an answer. Kimbers\n",

I'm sorry to hear about that. The heavy winds yesterday did lead to a restricted capacity. The exact cause of the delay can differ per flight, however. @KLM, in this case, will be able to give more insight into this. ^Jim   \n",

My delayed flight missed it’s connection. Stranded in Amsterdam BUT excellent service. Hotel, shuttle bus, food and drink, wash kit and most of all CARE! You have a very happy flyer despite my late arrival to business meeting. 5⭐️   \n",

I suffered a delay in a flight, several hours and over 3500km. Delays happen, I have understanding. But why are you offering me a 200€ coupon instead of the 600€ for each passenger you have to pay in these cases? This cannot be serious.   \n",

You sent checks for 600 euros. Now you say they are revoking them because our flight was to due to air traffic?? We had to spend the night and arrived home 24 hrs later than we should have. You did NOT provide meals or lodging! Who does this?   \n",

Everyone in my group gets compensated for their delayed baggage and yet KLM still won’t reply to my emails. How can they have such discrepancies in their service.  Don’t want to fly with you again after this!   \n",

It seems Schiphol flights take off on time to destinations all over the world but I also to seem to be regularly delayed on the last flight to Newcastle. Do KLM see this as an easy target?   \n",

I asked staff on board and they said that because 21 of us are also flying to Brisbane from Abu Dhabi, there's a chance the flight might be delayed for us. I'm hoping I don't have to stay the night in Abu Dhabi by myself...   \n",

So I went to the transfer desk &amp; got in line. They assumed my bag was delayed for the same reason as everyone else’s &amp; was in the airport, and so wouldn’t let me file a report, just told me to wait. 5/n   \n",

The arrogant sods said we have to wait another 45 minutes. FYI we were 3 hours 20 minutes delayed on the flight there. Request for compensation submitted. Reaction: ZERO. Now, we land on time - 1849 - one of my bags arrived at 1915, still waiting for the second.   \n",

I have attached the invoice of the purchase and reference number as well in the customer portal. But I don't see any acknowledgement from your end. So kindly get back to me at the earliest regarding the claim.   \n",

Ik zweer het je, I’m not paying almost 2 grand again to have a delayed flight for two hours since y’all don’t know how to remove a disruptive passenger in a timely manner. I still have the videos from the HORRIBLE flight 3 months ago. Js.   \n",

You outsourced to KL 2758 to @Atlasglobal The worst airline. Delayed flight for two hours, so missed connection, no one took responsibility. Paid extra for delta comfort, lost baggage.   \n",

No issues there. I just want to know the actual time our plane will arrive, board, and depart. 3/4 flights delayed... Weather is good in all locations. I don't mean to be rude I am just frustrated. You do a lot of things right.   \n",

Pretty simple concepts really. Anyway, doesn't matter to me.

Do not think that because you book a ticket via a major airline that if the partner one is delayed by over 4 or more hours you will  be entitled of any compensation,because you won’t !

That’s what I’ve done but the answer is now that the the case is complicated and no compensation will be payed as the rebooked flight brought us to Dublin with &lt;3h delay - without even hand luggage as we checked it in on your demand!

My hubs was supposed to fly with KLM but was rebooked by one of your agents due to a connection delay. KLM rebooked him with @airfrance.  Not sure who was responsible for the lost luggage, but it's been found. Picked it up from @HannoverAirport yesterday.   \n",

My husband and I are currently in Porto (OPO) heading to Amsterdam (AMS) then Split (SPU) on flight KL 2588 and KL 1947   Unfortunately flight KL 2588 is delayed and we will now miss our connection to Split.

If they delay it for a significant amount of time, which is defined differently by different airlines, they have to pay compensation. However, they will be exempt from paying compensation in this instant.   \n",
