And you won’t pay for us to stay passed 1 in our hotel so we have to leave even though our flight isn’t till 11 tonight and even that isn’t guaranteed. I’m expecting a refund!!!!   \n",

In delays more than 2 hours, you are entitled to reasonable food and drinks during the delay. You may keep receipts and send them along with their EU261 complaint. \\n\\nHugo   \n",

I only get the \"we're busy\" &amp; \"ur not elgible for a refund\"   \n",

We don't operate flights to Vietnam ourselves so you'll have a connection with one of our partners.

My fight was to leave at 510pm. I spent hours calling &amp; no one picked up or message said try again. Flight was delayed to 540. Not knowing what else to do, I logged on my bookings &amp; found a \"refund this booking\" link &amp; used it at 515.   \n",

But I am paying the same price on silk air as air Asia for this trip and just looknat the difference! Airlines can do it. Some just choose not to. Maybe I'm from another age where hospitality had value. Easyjet ok, but Ryan? I'd rather walk.\n",

We don't operate flights to Vietnam ourselves so you'll have a connection with one of our partners. I'm afraid we're unable to provide assistance with visas here and would recommend speaking with the embassy directly for an answer. Kimbers\n",

It was delayed by 1h. I am now getting onto flight KL0591. Will my checked in luggage still make its way onto the aircraft for KL0591 or will my luggage be put on a different flight i.e. not be in Johannesburg when I land?\\n\\nDank je wel!   \n",

My flight KL 808 from Taipei has been delayed - I think this could make me miss my connection to Manchester departing at 8am on Friday?  If so, can you confirm which flight I’d be rebooked on? Thanks   \n",

I suffered a delay in a flight, several hours and over 3500km. Delays happen, I have understanding. But why are you offering me a 200€ coupon instead of the 600€ for each passenger you have to pay in these cases? This cannot be serious.   \n",

What happened is this: my baggage was delayed somewhere during my itinerary (YKS-SVO-AMS-BOS) and was put on a later flight to Boston. At 6:30pm I received an email from KLM that my baggage was delayed and was instructed to file a report. 1/n https://t.co/ybtfqPgtoX   \n",

We’re delayed in GLA due to AMS bad weather. Am meant to get a 10am Ams-Hel flight but worried about missing connection due to initial 50+ min delay here in Gla. Are all flights delayed?

Pretty simple concepts really. Anyway, doesn't matter to me. I have one more flight to London tomorrow morning. €100 down on a delay of at least 45 minutes, and no change in your lack of accurate info.   \n",

Our bags were delayed on the first flight of our holidays and when they were delivered one was heavily heavily damaged. Your reply: have someone fix it. Great!

I've checked the status on the flight status checker and all seems good. However, just wanted to double check this is correct given the strikes at Schiphol.

Do not think that because you book a ticket via a major airline that if the partner one is delayed by over 4 or more hours you will  be entitled of any compensation,because you won’t !

I see that every day at my hometown's central city. \\nAnd DeutscheBahn is not as expensive as e.g. bloody UK. I often go to Munich from Hamburg travelling first class and can get tix for just 39 €.   \n",

My hubs was supposed to fly with KLM but was rebooked by one of your agents due to a connection delay. KLM rebooked him with @airfrance.  Not sure who was responsible for the lost luggage, but it's been found. Picked it up from @HannoverAirport yesterday.   \n",

My husband and I are currently in Porto (OPO) heading to Amsterdam (AMS) then Split (SPU) on flight KL 2588 and KL 1947   Unfortunately flight KL 2588 is delayed and we will now miss our connection to Split.

If they delay it for a significant amount of time, which is defined differently by different airlines, they have to pay compensation. However, they will be exempt from paying compensation in this instant.   \n",
