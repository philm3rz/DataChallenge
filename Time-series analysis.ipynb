As that price isn't available, it's not possible to make a booking using that price, as it's an error online. However, the actual price is available when the flight options are on the screen.

As long as the ticket is for travel between 3 and 30 March, no matter when bought, you should be able to change/get a voucher.  At least, I did (bought my ticket in January). Hope this helps  \n",
